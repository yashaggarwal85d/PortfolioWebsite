A revamped version of my original Spotify Profile project.

✨ Learn how to build this app from the ground up with my new course, [Build a Spotify Connected App](https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app). We cover how to implement **Spotify's OAuth flow** with Express.js, how to interact with the Spotify API with **React hooks** and **async/await**, how to build a professional, responsive UI with **Styled Components**, how to deploy an app with a React front-end and Node back-end with **Heroku**, and more. ✨
